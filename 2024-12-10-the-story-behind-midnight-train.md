Sometimes the best songs come from the most unexpected moments. "Midnight Train" was born during a late-night drive through the Tennessee countryside, when the world felt both infinite and intimate at the same time.

## The Inspiration

It was around 1 AM, and I was driving back from a small venue in Murfreesboro where I'd played an acoustic set for maybe twenty people. The show had been one of those magical nights where every song felt like a conversation, where the audience hung on every word.

As I drove through the darkness, passing small towns with their porch lights glowing like distant stars, I started thinking about journeys – not just the physical one I was on, but the metaphorical ones we all take. The late-night drives toward uncertain destinations, the decisions made in the quiet hours when the world sleeps.

## The Writing Process

I pulled over at a 24-hour diner and grabbed a coffee and a napkin. By the time I finished my cup, I had the chorus and the basic structure sketched out:

*"Take the midnight train to anywhere but here  
Leave behind the weight of another wasted year  
In the darkness, find the light you've been searching for  
Take the midnight train, don't look back anymore"*

The song wrote itself after that. It's about those moments when you realize you need to make a change, when staying still feels more dangerous than moving toward the unknown.

## Recording the Song

I recorded "Midnight Train" in my home studio, which is really just my bedroom with some acoustic treatment and a decent microphone. There's something about the intimacy of that space that felt right for this song.

I kept the arrangement simple – just acoustic guitar, vocals, and a subtle string arrangement that my friend Sarah added later. Sometimes the most powerful songs are the ones that don't try to do too much.

## What It Means to Me

"Midnight Train" represents a turning point in my songwriting. It's more personal than anything I've written before, but also more universal. It's about the courage to change, the beauty of uncertainty, and the hope that exists in movement.

Every time I play it live, I see people nodding along, and I know they're thinking about their own midnight trains – the journeys they've taken or the ones they're still afraid to board.

## Listen for Yourself

"Midnight Train" is available on all streaming platforms now. I hope it resonates with you the way it continues to resonate with me. And if you've got your own midnight train story, I'd love to hear it.

Music is about connection, after all.
