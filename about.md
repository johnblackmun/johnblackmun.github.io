# My Journey

I'm John Blackmun, a singer-songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee. My music tells stories of love, loss, and the beautiful complexity of human experience. With just an acoustic guitar and honest lyrics, I aim to create connections that transcend the ordinary.

## The Beginning

My musical journey started in 2018 when I picked up my first guitar in a small bedroom, armed with nothing but dreams and a desire to share my stories with the world. What began as late-night songwriting sessions soon evolved into something much bigger.

## Musical Style

My sound blends traditional folk storytelling with contemporary indie sensibilities. I draw inspiration from artists like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Bon Iver, creating music that feels both timeless and modern.

## Recent Achievements

- Released debut EP "Midnight Thoughts" in 2020
- Performed at over 50 venues across the Southeast
- Featured in Nashville Scene Magazine
- Currently working on my first full-length album

## Connect With Me

I love hearing from fellow music lovers and anyone who connects with my songs. Whether you want to share your own story or just say hello, I'd love to hear from you.
