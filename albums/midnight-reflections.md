My latest collection explores the quiet moments between day and night, where thoughts become melodies and emotions find their voice. Recorded in intimate settings over the course of a year, each track tells a story of love, loss, and the beauty found in life's simplest moments.

This album represents a new chapter in my artistic journey â€“ more personal, more vulnerable, and more honest than anything I've created before.
