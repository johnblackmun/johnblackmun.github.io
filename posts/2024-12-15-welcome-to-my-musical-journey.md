Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm John Blackmun, and I'm thrilled you've found your way here. This website is more than just a place to showcase my music â€“ it's a space where I can share the stories behind the songs, connect with fellow music lovers, and document this incredible journey I'm on.

## Why I Started This Site

Music has always been about connection for me. Whether I'm writing a song in my bedroom at 2 AM or performing on stage in front of a crowd, it's all about that moment when a melody or lyric resonates with someone else. This website is an extension of that desire to connect.

Here, you'll find:

- **My latest music** and where to stream it
- **Stories from the road** and studio sessions
- **The inspiration behind my songs** and creative process
- **Updates on tours, releases, and collaborations**
- **Personal reflections** on music, life, and everything in between

## What's Coming Next

I'm currently working on my first full-length album, and I can't wait to share that journey with you. From the initial songwriting sessions to the final mastering, I'll be documenting it all right here.

I'm also planning some exciting collaborations and have a few tour dates in the works for 2025. Stay tuned for announcements!

## Let's Connect

Music is a conversation, and I want to hear from you. Whether you connect with a particular song, have a story to share, or just want to say hello, don't hesitate to reach out. You can find me on social media or drop me an email.

Thank you for being here, and thank you for listening. This is just the beginning.

With gratitude,  
John
